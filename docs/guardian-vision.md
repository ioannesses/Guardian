## Investor Pitch Deck Outline

### 1. The Problem: The Digital Trust Collapse
- AI deepfakes are eroding truth.
- Data breaches and PII leaks are at an all-time high.
- Scams targeting the vulnerable are becoming indistinguishable from reality.

### 2. The Solution: The Guardian Protocol
- A decentralized, AI-driven trust layer.
- Real-time PII masking (Guardian Proxy).
- Real-time fact-checking and deepfake detection (Guardian Truth).

### 3. Market Opportunity

- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: AI Safety and Compliance tools ($10B+).
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: Protecting 1M+ families and 10k+ startups in Year 3.

### 4. Revenue Model (The Ethical ROI)

- **B2C (Family)**: Scam protection ($9/family).
- **Enterprise**: Deepfake detection for platforms (Custom).

### 5. Ethical Foundation
- **Privacy First**: We never see user data; all scanning is local or encrypted.
- **Open Transparency**: Core algorithms are open-source to build community trust.
- **Growth for All**: Part of the revenue goes into a "Digital Literacy Fund" to educate humanity.

### 6. The Roadmap
- **Q1**: Prototype PII Scanner & Proxy.
- **Q2**: Browser Extension Beta (Deepfake detection).
- **Q3**: Family Safe-Net Launch.

### 7. Why Now?
