# Guardian Protocol: Launch Day Readiness Checklist 🚀🛡️

Before you hit "Post" on LinkedIn or send that first investor email, run through this final list to ensure the Guardian Protocol is presented in its best light.

## 1. Technical Verification
- [ ] **Test Runner**: Run `node test-suite/runner.js` one last time. (Should be 100% PASS).
- [ ] **Browser Load**: Ensure the extension is loaded in Chrome/Edge and redacts PII on `test-scam-page.html`.
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Refresh `dashboard/index.html` and verify the "Investor Insights" and "GDPR Badge" are visible.

## 2. GitHub Presentation
- [ ] **README**: Check [github.com/ioannesses/Guardian](https://github.com/ioannesses/Guardian). Does the mission statement look bold and clear?
- [ ] **License**: Verify that the `LICENSE` file is the Source Available version.
- [ ] **Recent Commits**: Ensure the last commit message is "feat: Implement Freemium Tier Logic and Manual Verification Guide".

## 3. Communication Staging
- [ ] **Templates**: Copy your chosen template from `docs/outreach-guide.md` to a Notepad or draft email.
- [ ] **Personalization**: If emailing an investor, replace all `[Bracketed]` text with their specific details.
- [ ] **Asset Check**: Have the `investor-pitch-deck.md` and `family-guard-one-pager.md` open and ready to export or link.

## 4. The "Big Post" (LinkedIn)
- [ ] **Image Ready**: Have a high-quality screenshot of the extension popup or the dashboard ready to attach.
- [ ] **Draft Checked**: Read the "LinkedIn Announcement" one last time for any typos.
- [ ] **Link Working**: Click your GitHub link in the draft to make sure it doesn't 404.
