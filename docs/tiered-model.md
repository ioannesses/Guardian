## 💡 Tier Rationale & "Fairness"

### 1. The Pro Tier ($15/mo) - "The Power User"
- **Value**: High-intensity verification. For professionals, researchers, or high-profile individuals who process a high volume of digital content.
- **Key Feature**: AI Intent Analysis (detecting *why* a message is manipulative, not just that it is).

### 2. The Family Tier ($9/mo) - "The Moral Compass"
- **Is it fair to limit?**: In this tier, we **do not limit** safety-critical features like predator detection or PII redaction. We only limit high-compute features like video deepfake scanning to maintain the low $9/mo price point.
- **Key Feature: Junior Guard**. This allows parents to get a "Safety Summary" (no PII, just threat levels) of their children's digital exposure.

### 3. The Enterprise Tier - "The Compliance Engine"
- **Value**: Automating ethical compliance for an entire organization.
- **Key Feature**: **Proof of Trust (PoT) Certificates**. A generated report showing the company successfully redacted X amount of PII and blocked Y amount of deceptive attacks.

## 🎯 Strategic Differentiation
- **Free vs. Pro**: Free provides the "Shield" (Protection), Pro provides the "Brain" (Intelligence).
- **Family vs. Individual**: Family focuses on **Collective Safety** and **Vulnerability Protection**, while Individual focuses on **Productivity** and **Deep-Dive Verification**.

**Humanity First means basic safety is a right (Free), but advanced intelligence and high-compute protection is a premium service.**
