**The Global Trust Protocol: Protecting Humanity's Digital Future.**

GuardianAI is a decentralized "Digital Immune System" designed to protect truth and privacy in the AI era. We believe that digital safety is a human right, and our mission is to provide every individual and family with a shield against digital manipulation and privacy erosion.

## 🌍 Our Mission
To build a safer, more transparent digital world where truth and privacy are the default. We achieve this through:
- **Truth Verification**: Detecting deepfakes and AI-generated misinformation in real-time.
- **Privacy Protection**: Redacting PII locally before it ever leaves your device.
- **Ethical Intelligence**: flagging manipulative and predatory AI language.

## 🚀 Key Components

- **[Guardian Browser Extension](extension/)**: Your personal digital shield. Local-first threat detection for every page you visit.
- **[Guardian Ethical Filter](guardian-proxy.js)**: A real-time interceptor for privacy and trust in transit.
- **[Safe-Guarded Dashboard](dashboard/)**: Visualize your digital protection score and intercepted threats.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Engine**: Node.js & Vanilla JS (Deterministic detection engines)
- **Environment**: Local-first architecture (Your data, your device)
- **UI**: Premium Glassmorphism Design System

## 🤝 Join the Shield
